# fake_news_detection

This project is a comprehensive Machine Learning system that automatically detects fake news and categorizes it based on content. It uses a combination of traditional and modern techniques including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), TF-IDF feature extraction, Cosine Similarity, Clustering, and Reinforcement Learning for adaptive accuracy improvement.
